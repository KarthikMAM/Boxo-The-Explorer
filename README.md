# Boxo-The-Explorer
Explorer widget for windows

It is a widget model explorer which can be customized with only the things the user wants to have. It can be used to customize libraries. It also uses file-systems for sequential access to optimize the performance. It extracts the icons and thumbnails from the individual files and applications and caches the most commonly used thumbnails and icons to optimize the response time. It is forced to display on top of the other windows so that it can be easily reached while watching a movie or editing a text document. The drag and drop mode makes it easy to add new files and folders. It can also open folders within the Boxo engine or within the explorer window as desired
